# Object-Motion-Detector
Python is the programming language used to complete this beginner-friendly project based on Computer Vision using OpenCV. OpenCV provides real-time libraries and tools to process images, in this project we've used this to capture frames at every millisecond and displaying them repeatedly so that they look likes a video. Firstly, we'll convert our frame to grayscale so that it'll be easy to analyze pixel intensity. After the first step, we'll capture the first frame and store it in a variable as a static frame, so that all upcoming frames will be compared to this static frame. And, by smoothing the image and finding contours we can draw a rectangle around the object with a min. value of pixels, to be considered as an object, all this process will be completed inside the loop so that it'll give o/p as video. After this whole process, we'll use the DateTime module and pandas to create a .csv file which will keep the record of an object in the frame.
