# Object-Motion-Detector
Python as the programming language used to complete this begineer friedly project based on Computer Vision using OpenCV. OpenCV provides realtime libraries and tool to to process images, in this project we've used this to capture frames at every millisecond and displaying them repeatedly so that it look likes a video. Firstly, we'll convert our frame to gray scale so that it'll easy to analyze pixel intensity. After first step, we'll capture the first frame and store it in a variable as a static frame, so that all upcoming frames will be compared to this static frame. And, by smoothing image and finding contours we can draw a rectangle around the object with a min. value of pixel to be considered as a object, all thi process will be completed inside the loop so that it'll give o/p as video. After this whole process we'll use datetime module and pandas to create a .csv file which will keep the record of object in the frame.
